        <h2><strong>Hello, Wooooorld!</strong></h2>
        <p>
            I'm this guy over there. Obviously not quite as handsome as he is 'cause I'm older... and fatter.<br>
            I'm brazilian and since march 2022 I live in Teresópolis, a cold city I loved at first glance, 90 kilometers from Rio de Janeiro.<br>
            I always loved music and somewhere around my eighteen years I started to learn music by myself with my uncle's old acoustic guitar and of course, with a little help from my friends. I used to work as a musician but the pandemic messed with it.<br>
            The internet helped me a lot with learning guitar skills.<br>
            Here's a youtube channel I used to watch a lot for learning music. Paul Davids is the <strong>best</strong>.<br><br>

            I love being with my family making barbecues and drinking some beer, playing with my son and nephews and gaming. If somebody ask me to choose between coke and beer to drink for free for the rest of my life I would choose coke.<br>
            I used to work in my family's company but somethings just happened in my life and I had to start changing everything. First I had to choose what I was going to do for living and then I chose to code. A friend of mine told me about <strong>Trybe</strong> and then I was sure that that was the right way to walk on.<br>
            I'm really happy about being a <strong>Tryber</strong> and I keep going on, without giving up, with all the love and support I can receive from my wife and beloved son.<br><br>
